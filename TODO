# Super important
1. Avoid creating multiple socket-ssh connections upon tab switch.
2. Test if it even works or not with Kubernetes.

# Important
1. Add error modal to display error.
2. Change the response of StartContainer to include container name as well. Add setContainerIps and unsetContainerIps. - (Done. DONE)
3. Add spinner
4. Load configs conditionally. - (Done for development. DONE)
5. Premium users should not delete the containers upon unloading or atleast something similar.
6. Test for multiple containers. - (Done. DONE)
7. For kubernetes stop is not an option, so give an illusion that k8s has stopped the pod. - (Done. DONE)
8. beforeunload, not stopping container, stop the container. - (Done, added beacon endpoint. DONE)

10. Enforce password constraints.


TO Fix:
1. Scale the websockets.
2. Get the stream to work properly. - Migrated Code to node.
3. Clean code.

Immediate:
-----------
1. Bind a setTimeout handler that gets triggered every now and then. This will complete the login flow.
2. Implement gRPC on REST-Containers. Rename it to ContainerMaker and use gRPC.
3. Move the setup to kubernetes completely.
